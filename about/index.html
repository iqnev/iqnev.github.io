      <p>Hello there!
On this page, I&rsquo;d like to share more about myself. My name is Ivelin Yanev, and I was born in Burgas, Bulgaria. Looking back, my passion for technology was ignited by my father, who, like a typical Bulgarian, was skilled at home repairs. As life unfolded, I found myself in a technical school with a specialization in radio and television. It was there that I became a radio amateur and started collecting and restoring vintage Bulgarian equipment, primarily from the socialist era. This included a wide range of radio and television receivers, both assembled from discrete components and integrated units. Thankfully, during the socialist era, Bulgaria was a prominent producer of such equipment, with brands like Elpron, Pliska, Veliki Tarnovo 84, Resprom, Sofia 81, and Shipka leading the way.</p>
<p>To be candid, my software knowledge was quite limited during that period. However, I stumbled upon a renowned Bulgarian book from the golden age of Bulgarian computer production. This book, titled &ldquo;Do-it-yourself Microcomputer,&rdquo; provided detailed instructions on how to design a microcomputer from scratch. Inspired by this resource, I delved into working with microcontrollers from the PIK16 series, which were manufactured by the American company Microchip.</p>
<p>In the image below, you can see my own creation - the PIC programmer. This programmer is powered by a PIC 18F2550 microcontroller and interfaces through the serial port. It seamlessly integrates with MPLAB IDE software, Microchip&rsquo;s robust code development environment, facilitating program execution, stopping, and single-stepping.</p>
<img src="/images/pic-01.png" alt="PIC programmer" title="PIC programmer">
<p>Thanks to this PIC programmer, I&rsquo;ve successfully programmed an extensive array of Microchip PIC series, including the 10F, 12F, 16F, 18F, 24F, and 30F microcontrollers. It&rsquo;s noteworthy that this programmer also doubles as an EEPROM programmer, as it offers support for 12Cxx EEPROMs.</p>
<p>As a result, by the end of my school years, I had already built my first logic machine. This device was created using TTL integrated circuits and a 27C256 256K bit EPROM chip. Its core function was to measure voltage, frequency, temperature, and RPM, and display the results on a seven-segment display. Users could select different subroutines using buttons on the front panel.</p>
<img src="/images/pc-01.png" alt="Logic machine" title="Logic machine">
<p>After winning math competitions, I had the opportunity to choose which university to attend. I initially entered with the intention of working on automated systems, but my enthusiasm waned when I realized that finding a job in this field in Bulgaria was challenging. Consequently, during my second year at university, I shifted my focus towards more popular technologies in the web sphere.</p>
<p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve gained experience working in various companies, contributing to the design of robotic systems, industrial IoT solutions, web-based systems, and integrated parking systems. As a seasoned software engineer, I have extensive expertise in IoT, IIoT, Microservices, IoT Edge Gateway, and M2M. In recent years, my primary focus has been on developing critical and high-performance microservice-oriented systems using cutting-edge technologies such as Java Native Image and Go. With a solid grasp of software design patterns and architectural principles, I consistently deliver solutions that exceed client expectations while adhering to industry best practices. I&rsquo;ve also dabbled in various programming languages, including Java, C, Qt, JavaScript, PHP, and Erlang, but currently, my main focus is on JVM technologies. I firmly believe that programming languages are merely tools to achieve our goals.</p>
